## Summary

Extend the Certificates API with a mechanism to allow clients to request a
specific duration for the issued certificate.

## Motivation

Certificates issued through the certificate signing requests API are not
revocable today.  Furthermore, clients lack a way to control the duration of the
issued certificate.  Certificate approvers may have trust distinctions for
different clients.  For example, if an approver knows that a client stores their
private key in a HSM, they may be willing to approve for a longer certificate
duration.  Signers lack a per-CSR mechanism to control the certificate duration,
and thus are forced to learn this information out of band.  The built-in signers
use the same duration for all issued certificates, with the default being a one
year certificate lifespan (that is irrevocable with rotating the signer).

To increase the overall security of the Kubernetes ecosystem and allow clients
to request a particular duration for issued certificates, we propose extending
the Kubernetes certificates signing request API with a new optional spec field
that can be used to request a particular duration.

### Goals

- Allow clients to request a duration for requested certificates
- Allow the CSR API to be easily [adopted in the Kubernetes ecosystem](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3646)

### Non-Goals

- Requiring signers to honor the requested duration

## Proposal

Add a new field to the `spec` of the certificate signing requests API called
`expirationSeconds` that allows a client to request a desired duration for the
issued certificate.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

1. Alice creates a certificate signing request with `spec.expirationSeconds` set to `600`
1. The request is approved
1. The signer issues the signed certificate for `600` seconds
1. Alice is able to use the certificate for `10` minutes, after which it expires

#### Story 2

1. A privileged component `X` issues certificates for clients using the CSR API
1. Based on its internal policy, it creates CSRs with `spec.expirationSeconds` set to `900`
1. `X` approves the CSR and fetches the certificate once the signer issues it
1. `X` validates that the signer honored the `spec.expirationSeconds` field
1. `X` gives the certificate to the client
1. The certificate automatically expires in `15` minutes

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

N/A

### Risks and Mitigations

This functionality will serve to reduce risk and increase security in the
Kubernetes ecosystem by helping client migrate away from long lived certificates.

In the worst case scenario, the new field will be ignored, which does not reduce
security from the status quo.

## Design Details

This design is centered around a change to the `CertificateSigningRequestSpec`
structs found in the `k8s.io/api/certificates/v1` and `k8s.io/api/certificates/v1beta1`
packages.

A new optional `ExpirationSeconds` field will be added to this struct.  The go
doc comment describes the behavior of this field.  A `*uint32` is used because
the field is optional, must be positive and must not overflow JSON parsers.

```go
// CertificateSigningRequestSpec contains the certificate request.
type CertificateSigningRequestSpec struct {
  // ... other fields omitted for brevity

  // go doc omitted for brevity
  SignerName string `json:"signerName" protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=signerName"`

  // expirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the issued
  // certificate. The certificate signer may issue a certificate with a different
  // validity duration so a client must check the delta between the notBefore and
  // and notAfter fields in the issued certificate to determine the actual duration.
  //
  // The v1.22+ in-tree implementations of the well-known Kubernetes signers will
  // honor this field as long as the requested duration is not greater than the
  // maximum duration they will honor per the --cluster-signing-duration CLI
  // flag to the Kubernetes controller manager.
  //
  // Certificate signers may not honor this field for various reasons:
  //
  //   1. Old signer that is unaware of the field (such as the in-tree
  //      implementations prior to v1.22)
  //   2. Signer whose configured maximum is shorter than the requested duration
  //   3. Signer whose configured minimum is longer than the requested duration
  //
  // The minimum valid value for expirationSeconds is 600, i.e. 10 minutes.
  //
  // +optional
  ExpirationSeconds *uint32 `json:"expirationSeconds,omitempty" protobuf:"varint,8,opt,name=expirationSeconds"`

  // go doc omitted for brevity
  Usages []KeyUsage `json:"usages,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=usages"`

  // ... other fields omitted for brevity
}
```

The name `expirationSeconds` was chosen to match existing art in the token request
API.  Similarly, the minimum valid duration was chosen to match the token request
API as well.  As this is a security related field, individuals may be encouraged
to set this value to the minimum valid value to maximize security.  Since a certificate
with a short lifetime will require frequent rotation before the current certificate
expires (say at `80%` the lifetime of the certificate given that CSR approval
and signing is asynchronous which necessitates a buffer), `10` minutes seems like an
appropriate minimum to prevent accidental DOS against the CSR API.  Furthermore,
`10` minutes is a short enough lifetime that revocation is not of concern.

TODO spec is immutable after creation, changes are silently dropped
TODO jordan conversation re: upgrades and downgrades
TODO beta no feature gate

### Test Plan

Unit tests covering:

1. Validation logic for minimum duration
2. `pkg/controller/certificates/authority.PermissiveSigningPolicy` updates to handle `expirationSeconds`

Integration test covering:

1. Creating and approving CSRs and asserting that certificate signer controllers such as
   `pkg/controller/certificates/signer.NewKubeAPIServerClientCSRSigningController` honor
   `spec.expirationSeconds` by checking the duration of the issued certificate.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
  -->

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
  -->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.
-->

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
      -->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
    -->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.

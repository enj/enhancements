## Summary

During the rolling upgrade of an HA master, the API server instances may
use different storage versions encoding a resource. The [storageVersionHash][]
in the discovery document does not expose this disagreement. As a result, the
storage migrator may proceed with migration with the false belief that all API
server instances are encoding objects using the same storage version, resulting
in polluted migration.  ([details][]).

[storageVersionHash]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L979

## Motivation

==TODO==

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

### Goals

- Create an API that allows an external controller to observe what storage versions are in use by API servers in an HA setup

### Non-Goals

- Automatically running storage migration

## Proposal

We propose a way to show what storage versions all API servers are using, so
that the storage migrator can defer migration until an agreement has been
reached.

### Risks and Mitigations

==TODO==

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

## Design Details

### Resource Version API

We introduce a new API `StorageVersion`, in a new API group
`internal.apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1`.

```golang
//  Storage version of a specific resource.
type StorageVersion struct {
  TypeMeta
  // The name is <group>.<resource>.
  ObjectMeta

  // Spec is omitted because there is no spec field.
  // Spec StorageVersionSpec

  // API server instances report the version they can decode and the version they
  // encode objects to when persisting objects in the backend.
  Status StorageVersionStatus
}

// API server instances report the version they can decode and the version they
// encode objects to when persisting objects in the backend.
type StorageVersionStatus struct {
  // The reported versions per API server instance.
  // +optional
  ServerStorageVersions []ServerStorageVersion
  // If all API server instances agree on the same encoding storage version,
  // then this field is set to that version. Otherwise this field is left empty.
  // +optional
  AgreedEncodingVersion string

  // The latest available observations of the storageVersion's state.
  // +optional
  Conditions []StorageVersionCondition

}

// An API server instance reports the version it can decode and the version it
// encodes objects to when persisting objects in the backend.
type ServerStorageVersion struct {
  // The ID of the reporting API server.
  // For a kube-apiserver, the ID is configured via a flag.
  APIServerID string

  // The API server encodes the object to this version when persisting it in
  // the backend (e.g., etcd).
  EncodingVersion string

  // The API server can decode objects encoded in these versions.
  // The encodingVersion must be included in the decodableVersions.
  DecodableVersions []string
}


const (
  // Indicates that storage versions reported by all servers are equal.
  AllEncondingVersionsEqual StorageVersionConditionType = "AllEncodingVersionsEqual"
)

// Describes the state of the storageVersion at a certain point.
type StorageVersionCondition struct {
	// Type of the condition.
	Type StorageVersionConditionType
	// Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
	Status corev1.ConditionStatus
	// The last time this condition was updated.
	// +optional
	LastUpdateTime metav1.Time
	// The reason for the condition's last transition.
	// +optional
	Reason string
	// A human readable message indicating details about the transition.
	// +optional
	Message string
}
```

## Changes to API servers

In this section, we describe how to update and consume the StorageVersion API.

### Curating a list of participating API servers in HA master

API servers need such a list when updating the StorageVersion API. Currently,
such a list is already maintained in the "kubernetes" endpoints, though it is not
working in all flavors of Kubernetes deployments.

We will inherit the existing [mechanism][], but formalize the API and process in
another KEP. In this KEP, we assume all API servers have access to the list of
all participating API servers via some API.

[mechanism]:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/939

### Updating StorageVersion

During bootstrap, for each resource, the API server
* gets the storageVersion object for this resource, or creates one if it does
  not exist yet,
* gets the list of participating API servers,
* updates the storageVersion locally. Specifically,
  * creates or updates the .status.serverStorageVersions, to express this API
    server's decodableVersions and encodingVersion.
  * removes .status.serverStorageVersions entries whose server ID is not present
    in the list of participating API servers, such entries are stale.
  * checks if all participating API servers agree on the same storage version.
    If so, sets the version as the status.agreedEncodingVersion. If not, sets
    the status.agreedEncodingVersion to empty. The "AllEncodingVersionsEqual"
    status.condition is updated accordingly as well.
* updates the storageVersion object, using the rv in the first step
  to avoid conflicting with other API servers.
* installs the resource handler.

The above mentioned process requires an API server to update the storageVersion
before accepting API requests. If we don't enforce this order, data encoded in
an unexpected version can sneak into etcd. For example, an API server persists a
write request encoded in an obsoleted version, then it crashes before it can
update the storageVersion. The storage migrator has no way to detect this write.

For the cmd/kube-apiserver binary, we plan to enforce this order by adding a new
filter to the [handler chain][]. Before kube-aggregator, kube-apiserver, and
apiextension-apiserver have registered the storage version of the built-in
resources they host, this filter only allows the following requests to pass:
1. a request sent by the loopbackClient and is destined to the storageVersion
   API.
2. the verb of the request is GET.
3. the request is for an API that is not persisted, e.g.,
   SubjectAccessReview and TokenReview. [Here] is a complete list.
4. the request is for an aggregated API, because the request is handled by the
   aggregated API server.
5. the request is for a custom resource, because the apiextension apiserver
   makes sure that it updates the storage version before it serves the CR (see
   [CRDs](#crds)).

The filter rejects other requests with a 503 Service Unavailable response code.

[handler chain]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/fc8f5a64106c30c50ee2bbcd1d35e6cd05f63b00/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/config.go#L639
[Here]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/709a0c4f7bfec2063cb856f3cdf4105ce984e247/pkg/master/storageversionhashdata/data.go#L26

One concern is that the storageVersion API becomes a single-point-of-failure,
though it seems inevitable in order to ensure the correctness of the storage
migration.

We will also add a post-start hook to ensure that the API server reports not
ready until the storageVersions are up-to-date and the filter is turned off.

### Garbage collection

There are two kinds of "garbage":

1. stale storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions entries left by API servers
   that have gone away;
2. storageVersion objects for resources that are no longer served.

We can't rely on API servers to remove the first kind of stale entries during
bootstrap, because an API server can go away after other API servers bootstrap,
then its stale entries will remain in the system until one of the other API
servers reboots.

Hence, we propose a leader-elected control loop in API server to clean up the
stale entries, and in turn clean up the obsolete storageVersion objects. The
control loop watches the list of participating API servers, upon changes, it
performs the following actions for each storageVersion object:

* gets a storageVersion object
* gets the list of participating API servers,
* locally, removes the stale entries (1st kind of garbage) in
  storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions,
  * after the removal, if all participating API servers have the same
    encodingVersion, then sets storageVersion.status.AgreedEncodingVersion and
    status.condtion.
* checks if the storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions is empty,
  * if empty, deletes the storageVersion object (2nd kind of garbage),
  * otherwise updates the storageVersion object,
  * both the delete and update operations are preconditioned with the rv in the
    first step to avoid conflicting with API servers modifying the object.

An API server needs to establish its membership in the list of participating API
servers before updating storageVersion, otherwise the above control loop can
mistake a storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions entry added by a new API
server as a stale entry.

### CRDs

Today, the [storageVersionHash][] in the discovery document in HA setup can
diverge from the actual storage version being used. See the [appendix][] for
details.

[appendix]:#appendix
[storageVersionHash]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c008cf95a92c5bbea67aeab6a765d7cb1ac68bd7/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L989

To ensure that the storageVersion.status always shows the actual encoding
versions, the apiextension-apiserver must update the storageVersion.status
before it [enables][] the custom resource handler. This way it does not require
the [filter][] mechanism that is used by the kube-apiserver to ensure the
correct order.

[enables]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/220498b83af8b5cbf8c1c1a012b64c956d3ebf9b/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/customresource_handler.go#L703
[filter]:#updating-storageversion

### Aggregated API servers

Most code changes will be done in the generic apiserver library, so aggregated
API servers using the library will get the same behavior.

If an aggregated API server does not use the API, then the storage migrator does
not manage its API.

## Consuming the StorageVersion API

The consumer of the StorageVersion API is the storage migrator. The storage
migrator
* starts migration if the storageVersion.status.agreedEncodingVersion differs
  from the storageState.status.[persistedStorageVersionHashes][],
* aborts ongoing migration if the storageVersion.status.agreedEncodingVersion is
  empty.

[persistedStorageVersionHashes]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-storage-version-migrator/blob/60dee538334c2366994c2323c0db5db8ab4d2838/pkg/apis/migration/v1alpha1/types.go#L164

## StorageVersion API vs. StorageVersionHash in the discovery document

We do not change how the storageVersionHash in the discovery document is
updated. The only consumer of the storageVersionHash is the storage migrator,
which will convert to use the new StorageVersion API. After the StorageVersion
API becomes stable, we will remove the storageVersionHash from the discovery
document, following the standard API deprecation process.

## Backwards Compatibility

There is no change to the existing API, so there is no backwards compatibility
concern.

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

- `<test>: <link to test coverage>`

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

- `<test>: <link to test coverage>`

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testingâ€”e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

### Version Skew Strategy

1. Q: if an API server is rolled back when the migrator is in the middle of
   migration, how to prevent corruption? ([original question][])

   A: Unlike the discovery document, the new StorageVersion API is persisted in
   etcd and has the resourceVersion(RV) field, so the migrator can determine if
   the storage version has changed in the middle of migration by comparing the
   RV of the storageVersion object before and after the migration. Also, as an
   optimization, the migrator can fail quickly by aborting the ongoing migration
   if it receives a storageVersion change event via WATCH.

   [original question]:https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1176#discussion_r307977970

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [X] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: StorageVersionAPI
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

Enabling the feature will enable a new API in the apiserver, but this should not change
any behaviors for existing workloads in the cluster.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, like any other alpha API, it can be disabled with runtime config.
Cluster admins should be mindful of any existing consumers of this API before rolling back.
Given this is an internal API, we don't anticipate many external consumers though.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Such like any alpha API, disabling the feature will prevent kube-apiserver from serving the API,
but will not remove objects from etcd. Re-enabling the feature will allow apiserver to serve the
API again. If the feature is re-enabled against a newer API version, it should be converted after a roundtrip.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

There are several tests that require the feature gate to be enabled [test/integration/storageversion/storage_version_filter_test.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ea0764452222146c47ec826977f49d7001b0ea8c/test/integration/storageversion/storage_version_filter_test.go)
and [test/integration/storageversion/gc_test.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0a7f45d5baa88dbe4d71102abe3a751a829d87a2/test/integration/storageversion/gc_test.go).

However, there are no tests that test feature enablement/disablement based on the gate, these should be added prior to Beta.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

Some potential rollout/rollback failures:
* bugs in conversion code could make re-enabling the API on newer versions unsafe
* bugs in the API / controllers could falsely report the desired storage version of an API, causing undesired storage migration from external consumers (e.g. kube-storage-version-migrator).
* a paused/stuck upgrade could block writes to resources where the agreed encoding version has not reached consensus.
* rolling back the feature and disabling the API could break clients of a cluster that depended on the API

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Recently added [apiserver health check metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112741) would be useful here:
  - kubernetes_healthcheck{name="poststarthook/built-in-resources-storage-version-updater",type="healthz"}
  - kubernetes_healthcheck{name="poststarthook/built-in-resources-storage-version-updater",type="readyz"}
  - kubernetes_healthcheck{name="poststarthook/built-in-resources-storage-version-updater",type="livez"}

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

Not yet, but manual validation should be complete prior to Beta. Steps for manual validation should be reported in this section of the KEP before Beta.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

Operators can check the existence of the StorageVersion API, as well as apiserver
health check metrics to check that the feature is working as expected.
Operations against the StorageVersion API can be checked to see if the API is in use by any controllers in the cluster.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason:
- [X] API .status
  - Condition name:
  - Other field: `.status.storageVersions`, `.status.commonEncodingVersion`
- [X] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: audit logs showing operations against StorageVersion API

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

Regarding availablility/latency of serving the new API, this should follow the [existing latency SLOs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#steady-state-slisslos)
for serving mutating or read-only API calls.

Reasonable SLOs specific to the StorageVersion API could be:
- storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions is accurately updated for an apiserver within 1 minute of start-up.
- storageVersion.status.agreedEncodingVersion is accurately updated for the cluster within 1 minute of completing an upgrade.

1 minute seems reasonable since this feature depends on the `APIServerIdentity` feature, that relies on a heart beat from each apiserver
to create a new Lease object obtaining an ID that will be used in the `storageVersion.status.serverStorageVersions[*].apiServerID` field.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [X] Metrics
  - Metric name: `kubernetes_healthcheck{name="poststarthook/built-in-resources-storage-version-updater"}`
  - Components exposing the metric: kube-apiserver

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

The following metrics could be useful, but are likely not practical due to cardinality issues or complexity of the implementation:
- The latency for a single apiserver to update it's encoding version after start-up
- The latency for all apiservers to reach a consensus on the agreed encoding version for a storage version

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No, but it does depend on the `APIServerIdentity` feature in kube-apiserver.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

Yes, there would be new API calls for the StorageVersion API. We don't anticipate
a lot of traffic for this API since the only anticipated consumer would be controllers
such as [kube-storage-version-migrator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-storage-version-migrator).

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

Yes, the StorageVersion API. There will be 1 object per API group.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

SLIs/SLOs for API calls could be impacted in cases where kube-apiservers have not reached consensus on the encoding version for a resource
for a long duration of time. This could be possible during version skew of kube-apiservers or other reasons that pause an upgrade.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

The API will not be served if kube-apiserver or etcd is unavailable.
Since this feature is tightly coupled to kube-apiserver and etcd already,
unavailability of either component would make the feature inaccessible.

In some cases where only etcd is unavailable, the desired storage version reported
by apiserver could be stale. However this should not be a big concern since
objects during this time would not be receiving writes anyways and the storage version would
be updated eventually when etcd is available again. In no situation can the agreed
encoding version flip back to an old version when etcd is unavailable, since this
would only happen once all kube-apiserver's have succesfully reported the new version.

###### What are other known failure modes?

- [StorageVersion API is not being updated]
  - Detection: `kubernetes_healthcheck{name="poststarthook/built-in-resources-storage-version-updater",type="healthz"}`
      indicates that the storage version updater is not running.
  - Mitigations: Check kube-apiserver logs for specific errors. Restarting may be helpful.
  - Diagnostics: Errors from the [storage version hanndler chain](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e11f23eb9712c9b4bebf8dd85dcb04441b4fb705/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/filters/storageversion.go#L110)
  - Testing: There can be many reasons for why kube-apiserver can't update an API that are hard to reproduce in a test.

- [Pending storage migrations can block writes to resources]
  - Detection: kube-apiserver returns 503 on writes with error `wait for storage version registration to complete for resource: <resource>`
  - Mitigations: Check kube-apiserver logs for specific errors and check etcd health
  - Diagnostics: Errors from the [storage version hanndler chain](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e11f23eb9712c9b4bebf8dd85dcb04441b4fb705/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/filters/storageversion.go#L110)
  - Testing: Updates to storage version can fail for many reasons (e.g. connectivity to etcd) that are hard to reproduce in a test.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

As a last resort, cluster admins can check kube-apiserver logs for errors that may indicate
why the StorageVersion is not being updated. In many cases when there are issues with StorageVersion,
operators should check the health of etcd in their clusters.

## Alternatives

### Letting API servers vote on the storage version

See [#1201](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/920)

The voting mechanism makes sure all API servers in an HA cluster always use the
same storage version, and the discovery document always lists the selected
storage version.

Cons:
* The voting mechanism adds complexity. For the storage migrator to work
  correctly, it is NOT necessary to guarantee all API server instances always
  use the same storage version.

### Letting the storage migrator detect if API server instances are in agreement

See [#920](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/920)

Cons: it has many assumptions, see [cons][].

## Appendix

### Accuracy of the discovery document of CRDs

Today, the storageVersionHash listed in the discovery document "almost"
accurately reflects the actual storage version used by the apiextension-apiserver.

Upon storage version changes in the CRD spec,
* [one controller][] deletes the existing resource handler of the CRD, so that
  a new resource handler is created with the latest cached CRD spec is created
  upon the next custom resource request.
* [another controller][] enqueues the CRD, waiting for the worker to updates the
  discovery document.

[one controller]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/1a53325550f6d5d3c48b9eecdd123fd84deee879/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/customresource_handler.go#L478
[another controller]:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/1a53325550f6d5d3c48b9eecdd123fd84deee879/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/customresource_discovery_controller.go#L258

These two controllers are driven by the [same informer][], so the lag between
when the server starts to apply the new storage version and when the discovery
document is updated is just the difference between when the respective
goroutines finish.

Note that in HA setup, there is a lag between when apiextension-apiserver
instances observe the CRD spec change.
